## Overview

Player2113 is a desktop CLI tool to help CS2113/T students revise Java OOP concepts in a gamification environment.
The user first chooses a topic, answers the questions, and then reviews the solutions.
The application has about 3.6k lines of code and is written in Java.

### Summary of Contributions

* **New Feature:** Added the ability to view solutions: `solution`
    * What it does: allows the user to view all solutions to a previously attempted topic or to view the solution to a
      previously attempted specific question
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as this is part of the product's purpose: for
      users to view solutions to previously attempted questions
    * Highlights: Depending on the number of user inputs, this feature allows the user to either view all solutions to
      a topic or view 1 solution to a specific question. The implementation therefore needed additional parsing of user
      inputs to accurately differentiate between displaying all or just one solution.


* **New Feature:** Added the ability to view explanations: `explain`
    * What it does: allows the user to view all explanations to a previously attempted topic or to view the explanation
      to a previously attempted specific question
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as this extends the usefulness of the product: for
      users to view the explanations to solutions if they do not understand them.
    * Highlights: Depending on the number of user inputs, this feature allows the user to either view all explanations
      to a topic or view 1 explanation to a specific question. The implementation therefore needed additional parsing of
      user inputs to accurately differentiate between displaying all or just one explanation.


* **Feature Enhancement:** Added the ability to choose a random
  topic ([#54](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-F15-1/tp/pull/54))
    * What it does: allows the user to choose a random topic amongst the list of topics displayed
    * Justification: This feature improves the product's gamification aspect: this random feature adds variation and
      challenge to the user experience when using this product.
    * Highlights: This enhancement closely works with the controller responsible for choosing which topic to display
      questions from. Due to the nature of java's Random library, additional checks have to be made to ensure random
      number generated is not invalid like 0 or an out-of-bounds index.

* **Enhancements to existing features:**
    * Made GUI more user-friendly with line breaks ([#40](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-F15-1/tp/pull/40/files))
    * Added Parser class testing to increase line test coverage from 0% to
      9% due to code regression ([#75](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-F15-1/tp/pull/75/files), [#82](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-F15-1/tp/pull/82/files))
